This is currently an experimental Node.js extension.
As of right now it does not work. There are some issues with the compiled version that I think may have to do with the linker options I am using for my waf build wscript.

The following is the error I get when using require in node.
>var g = require("./build/default/nodefgdb.node")
Error: /home/odoe/dev/node_fgdb/build/default/nodefgdb.node: undefined symbol: _ZTIN10FileGDBAPI11ShapeBufferE
