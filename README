This is currently an experimental Node.js extension.
As of right now it does not work. There are some issues with the compiled version that I think may have to do with the linker options I am using for my waf build wscript.

I am able to get the extension to compile, however I get an undefined symbol error when trying to use it.

> var test = require("./build/default/nodefgdb");
> var gdb = new test.NodeFGDB();
> gdb.query();
node: symbol lookup error: /home/odoe/dev/node_fgdb/build/default/nodefgdb.node: undefined symbol: _ZN10FileGDBAPI11GeodatabaseC1Ev

I'm making small strides, but any input would be appreciated.
